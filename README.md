### Introduction 

Data doesn't exist in a vacuum. Whatever dataset you're working with, the chances are good that someone else has already played with it. Wouldn't it be great if instead of starting from scratch, you could incorporate what they've learned into what you're learning right away?

Unfortunately we in the data science community haven't (yet) invested in tools for **transferable data insight**. The resources that we need to operate more quickly are scattered across servers and hard drives around the world.

A **data graph** is a collection of annotations describing a dataset. Nodes in a data graph include:

* Literate explorations of the data conducted by other users.
* Visualizations using the data.
* Comments on the data.
* External resources, such as external metadata.
* Suggested datasets for joining or additional context.


### Application

This repository contains a prototype application allowing you to define, export, and share arbitrary data graphs. Currently still in active development!
